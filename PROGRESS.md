# PROGRESS — handoff

_Last updated: 2026-10-26 (Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26300 x64, Node 26.7.0, pnpm 12.14.0 via npx, rustc 1.99.1, aria2 1.37.0 in tools/aria2)_

## Current milestone
**B1.6 (service-owned file naming and file-system limits, ADR 0011): implemented and committed as `93faed3`; every check passes locally on Windows 11 (see below); CI #25 was still running when this was written.**

Previous baseline: `e895f2b` (B1.5). CI #24 failed on macos-latest and ubuntu-24.04 because of an admission-order bug in B1.5 (ties within one millisecond were broken by random job IDs); this change fixes it. Package-smoke #14 is green on all three. The B1.5 documentation updates that `e895f2b` lacked are applied in this change.

CI evidence is the public job conclusion (and the failure annotation `scripts/verify.mjs` emits) of each run; full job logs need GitHub authentication.

## Backends (ADR 0005)
`dm-service` defaults to the built-in `dm-backend-http` (Http, Https, ResumeStrongValidator, SegmentedHttp supported); aria2 only with `--backend aria2` (Http only) and never bundled while REL-05 is open. No fallback between backends.

## Completed (summary)
- Foundation; ADRs 0001–0005; CI on 4 OSes; aria2 adapter (hardened); service (user-only IPC, capability gates, service-owned retry); `dm` CLI.
- `dm-backend-http`: HTTP/HTTPS with platform trust, manual redirects, origin-scoped credentials, identity encoding, validated pause/resume, validated segmentation.
- Reports: [aria2 B0.4](docs/reports/b0.4-http-correctness.md), [dm-backend-http](docs/reports/b0.4.2-http-backend.md), [B0.5 packaging](docs/reports/b0.5-packaging-smoke.md).

### This session — B1.6 ([report](docs/reports/b1.6-file-naming.md), ADR 0011)
- **`dm-backend-api`:**
  - `BackendProgress.naming: Option<ResponseNaming>` (unparsed `Content-Disposition` ≤ 4 KiB, still-encoded final URL segment; never the query);
  - `destination_refused` (shared file-system refusal mapping);
  - `TransferRequest.file_name` documented as the stable staging name.
- **`dm-backend-http`:** records naming from the final `200` after redirects (and a validated `206` when the attempt saw no `200`); non-UTF-8 field bytes read as ISO-8859-1; `InvalidFilename` / `PermissionDenied` / `ReadOnlyFilesystem` / not-a-folder → `DESTINATION_UNWRITABLE`. aria2 reports no naming.
- **Contract:** `ErrorKind` gains `DESTINATION_UNWRITABLE` (schema, TypeScript, Rust).
- **`dm-service` `naming.rs`:**
  - RFC 6266/8187 parser (precedence `filename*` > `filename` > response URL > request URL > `download`; duplicates ignored; UTF-8/ISO-8859-1 only);
  - NFC sanitizer (separators, controls, bidi overrides, leading/trailing dots and spaces, Windows device names incl. `COM¹`, control suffixes);
  - `fit`: 255 UTF-16 units (Windows) / 255 UTF-8 bytes (elsewhere), 24-unit suffix reserve, 259-unit / 4095-byte path target with a 32-unit floor, grapheme-safe truncation keeping the extension;
  - `unique`: existing entries, other jobs' final and staging names (NFC, case-insensitive), foreign `.downova-part` / `.aria2` files.
- **`dm-service` core:**
  - the staging name is fixed at acceptance and given to every attempt;
  - `select_final_name` freezes the final name the first time metadata arrives (before finalization in the same poll), persists it and traces `name_selected`;
  - finalization freezes the provisional name at the journal intent at the latest; aria2's engine-placed file keeps its path;
  - placement refusals by the file system → `DESTINATION_UNWRITABLE`;
  - admission order: creation time, then acceptance order (fixes the CI #24 failure).
- **`dm-storage` migration 4:** `jobs.staging_name` and `jobs.name_source`; existing jobs become `legacy` (frozen, staging = display name).
- **Docs:**
  - ADR 0011, the B1.6 report, architecture, testing, roadmap (B1.6 done, B1.7 next);
  - requirements E04 `implemented`;
  - traceability E04, CORE-11, ADV05;
  - the B1.5 doc updates; ADR 0010 and the B1.5 report note the corrected tie-break.

### Earlier — B1.5 ([report](docs/reports/b1.5-connection-budget.md), ADR 0010, `e895f2b`)
- **`dm-backend-http` `limits.rs`:**
  - `HostLimiter`: one semaphore per host key (lowercase/punycode host, trailing dot removed, port and scheme ignored), `HttpConfig.max_connections_per_host` = 8;
  - a permit is taken before every request (probe, transfer, resumed range, segment worker, each redirect hop) and held until its body is dropped; redirects release the previous hop first;
  - waiting stops with the attempt;
  - `pool_max_idle_per_host(0)`.
- **`dm-service` admission:**
  - `MAX_ACTIVE_FILES` = 3;
  - a `Pending` start (`Fresh` / `Resume`) shows `queued` + `queue_limit`;
  - `Core::admit` (oldest first; never waits) runs after add, resume, pause, cancel, every poll and recovery;
  - slots are held only by live, user-running, non-finalizing, non-blocked attempts;
  - recovered attempts are restored paused and then admitted;
  - a never-started queued job stays queued across a restart;
  - an immediate resume still returns its refusal; a refusal at admission leaves the job paused, never failed.
- **Fixture:** `Server` counts open TCP connections and records each connection's lifetime (`max_overlap`, `max_overlap_since`, `url_on`).
- **Docs:**
  - ADR 0010, the B1.5 report, architecture, testing, roadmap;
  - requirements CORE-02 and E03 `implemented`;
  - traceability E03, CORE-02, CORE-03;
  - the B1.4 doc updates.

### Earlier — B1.4 ([report](docs/reports/b1.4-disk-budget.md), ADR 0009, `0b14fbd`)
- **`dm-platform::space`:**
  - `SpaceProbe` trait; `OsSpaceProbe` (`fs4::available_space`) returns `Available` / `VolumeMissing` / `Unavailable`, never an invented number;
  - debug-only `FileSpaceProbe` via `DOWNOVA_TEST_FREE_SPACE_FILE`.
- **`dm-backend-api`:** `SpaceGuard` trait plus `NoSpaceGuard`. Backends get the guard through `HttpConfig.space`, with no dependency on platform or service.
- **`dm-service::space::PlatformSpaceGuard`:** a 64 MiB margin; advisory pass when unknown (reported once); `DISK_FULL` / `VOLUME_MISSING` with actionable text.
- **`dm-backend-http`:**
  - budget before the first body byte and at every durable sync (unknown length: the next 4 MiB window);
  - segmented budgets the whole unconfirmed length before sizing;
  - `QuotaExceeded` is also classified `DISK_FULL`;
  - checkpoints stay exportable after a failure;
  - debug-only `enospc_write` / `enospc_sync` faults.
- **`dm-service` core:**
  - `block_on_disk` commits the checkpoint, releases the attempt (keeping the partial file; with nothing durable the unconfirmed partial is removed) and sets the `disk_unavailable` / `volume_missing` blocker, keeping desired_state;
  - `recheck_disk` every 2 s, then a validated restore or a fresh start;
  - resume of a waiting job only restores its desired state;
  - a waiting job without a checkpoint keeps waiting across a restart;
  - aria2 keeps terminal disk-full failure.
- **Finalization:** the copy fallback is budgeted; `ENOSPC` in the copy removes only the partial copy; the job waits at `verified` (journal kept); faults `no_hard_links` and `enospc_copy`; `DOWNOVA_FAULT` is now a comma-separated list.
- **Docs:**
  - ADR 0009, the B1.4 report, architecture, testing, roadmap;
  - requirements ADV05 `in-progress`;
  - traceability ADV05, COR-07, CORE-04.

### Earlier — B1.3 ([report](docs/reports/b1.3-completion-journal.md), ADR 0008, `370c424`)
- **API:**
  - `dm-backend-api`: `StagedOutput` (`Staged(path)` | `PlacedByEngine(path)`) and `staged_output`. `Complete` now means staged and synced.
  - `dm-backend-http` no longer publishes (the unsafe rename fallback is removed). A fully confirmed checkpoint finishes without a range request.
  - aria2 reports `PlacedByEngine`.
- **Contract:**
  - `DownloadSnapshot.verification` = `{ sha256, source: local_hash | publisher_checksum }`;
  - schema, TypeScript, Rust mirror, `download-snapshot.completed` example.
- **`dm-storage` migration 3:**
  - `finalization_journal`, plus `jobs.verified_sha256` and `jobs.verification_source`;
  - `begin_finalization`, `advance_finalization`, `abandon_finalization`, `finish_finalization`, `load_journal` (attempt-checked; `completed` with evidence and checkpoint removal in one transaction);
  - cancelled or failed jobs drop their entry.
- **`dm-service` `core/finalize.rs`:**
  - stages: intent → verified (length, SHA-256, trusted checksum; a mismatch deletes the bad staging file) → placed (`place_no_overwrite`: hard link, else `create_new` + synced copy re-verified) → complete → cleanup;
  - reconciliation at startup, before checkpoint recovery, re-checking files by SHA-256;
  - cancel refused once placed;
  - debug-only fault hooks `DOWNOVA_FAULT`.
- **Backend tests:** adapted to staged output (the destination is never written by the backend).
- **Host test:** `a_refused_caller_is_answered_before_its_input_is_read` accepts success or `BrokenPipe` for the late write (Linux fd inheritance race, CI #21).
- **Docs:**
  - ADR 0008, the B1.3 report, architecture §7, testing, roadmap, this file;
  - the B1.2 doc updates that were missing from `f73a41a` (requirements, traceability, architecture, testing, roadmap);
  - requirements ADV06, COR-05, CORE-04 `in-progress`.

### Earlier — B1.2 ([report](docs/reports/b1.2-crash-recovery.md), ADR 0007, `f73a41a`)
- **API:**
  - `dm-backend-api`: `DurableCheckpoint` (opaque, versioned, ≤ 64 KiB) with `checkpoint` / `restore`;
  - new capability `durable_resume` (schema and TypeScript regenerated): `http` Supported, aria2 Unsupported (aria2 refuses restore).
- **`dm-backend-http`:**
  - writers flush + `sync_data` + publish confirmed state at least every 1 s / 4 MiB and on stop;
  - `durable.rs` format v1 (mode, destination binding, final URL, strong ETag, length, regions with SHA-256 digests; no hasher state);
  - import re-verifies the regions and rebuilds the hashers, truncates single-connection bytes past the checkpoint, and refuses foreign, corrupt, newer, misbound, damaged or destination-existing cases.
- **`dm-storage` migration 2:**
  - `jobs.attempt_id` and `resume_checkpoints`;
  - `save_checkpoint` (job + checkpoint in one transaction; `StaleAttempt` refusal), `rebind_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`;
  - `update_job` drops checkpoints of finished or re-attempted jobs.
- **`dm-service`:**
  - checkpoints on pause (with the paused state), every 2 s while transferring if they grew, and at graceful shutdown (`prepare_shutdown`);
  - `recover()` at start: a new attempt, a backend restore, an atomic rebind; paused jobs stay paused; refused restores fail with `RECOVERY_FAILED: …`;
  - `INTERRUPTED` remains for jobs without a usable checkpoint;
  - test hook `DOWNOVA_CHECKPOINT_TRACE`.
- **CI diagnostics:** `scripts/verify.mjs` emits a GitHub error annotation with the tail of each failed step (CI only).
- **Docs:**
  - ADR 0007, the B1.2 report, architecture §7, testing, roadmap;
  - requirements: ARCH-05 `implemented`; CORE-04, COR-08, ADV06 `in-progress`;
  - traceability.

### Earlier — B1.1 repair (CI #17)

## Checks actually run (local, Windows 11 Pro 10.0.26300 x64, 2026-10-26)
| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `cargo test -p dm-service --lib` ×6 | PASSED 56 each (incl. `naming::tests` 10, core naming 5); before the tie-break fix 4 of 5 runs failed an admission test, as in CI #24 |
| `cargo test -p dm-storage` | PASSED 21 (v3 → v4 migration keeps names as `legacy`) |
| `cargo test -p dm-backend-http --test naming`, `--lib naming_inputs` | PASSED 3 + 1 (NB01–NB03, Latin-1) |
| `cargo test -p dm-service --test http_backend_process nm0` ×3 | PASSED 4/4 each (NM01–NM04) |
| `cargo test -p dm-service --test http_backend_process` | PASSED 40/40 |
| `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all --check` | PASSED |
| `pnpm contracts:gen` | OK (13 valid and 7 invalid examples behave as expected) |
| `pnpm verify:strict` (B1.6 tree, desktop app closed) | PASSED: 19 passed, 0 failed, 0 unavailable (incl. native host e2e, aria2 service process and CLI real service that the B1.5 run could not rebuild) |

No macOS or Linux run of B1.6 exists yet; CI will provide it after a push. NM02 has a separate expectation for case-sensitive Linux volumes that has not run.

## Honest limitations
- B1.6:
  - limits are per platform, not probed per volume (eCryptfs, some network shares refuse at creation → `DESTINATION_UNWRITABLE`);
  - deep folders rely on long-path support beyond the 32-unit floor;
  - no RFC 2231 continuations or RFC 2047 words;
  - a file appearing at the frozen name stops placement explicitly (no automatic rename);
  - aria2 jobs keep URL names;
  - permission and read-only refusals are classified but not process-tested on a real restricted folder;
  - the UI does not show the name change yet (B2).
- B1.5:
  - the per-host guarantee counts Downova's open requests; servers see sub-100 ms teardown tails (measured, reported raw);
  - the budget is per backend instance;
  - no idle pool: a handshake per request, not benchmarked;
  - no speed claims;
  - no stalled-server timeout test;
  - aria2 is conservatively 1 connection per file;
  - limits are fixed, with no priorities or queues (B2).
- B1.4:
  - advisory snapshots, no reservations across concurrent jobs; fixed 64 MiB margin;
  - `ENOSPC` injected, not observed on a real full disk;
  - unknown-length or validator-less downloads restart after disk full;
  - SQLite failing on a full disk is reasoned about, not fault-tested;
  - no removable-volume identity (B4);
  - aria2 disk full stays terminal;
  - the UI does not show blockers (B2).
- B1.3:
  - process kills only (no power-loss claim; no directory sync on Windows);
  - a crash mid-copy leaves a partial final file reported as a collision;
  - aria2 places before verifying;
  - hashing holds the coordinator lock.
- B1.2: no `synchronous=FULL` benchmark; recovery reads confirmed data twice; aria2 jobs end as interrupted.
- B0.6: Edge not run; the menu click is simulated; the installer does not register the host (REL-01).
- Packages are unsigned (macOS ad-hoc) and not notarised.

## Blockers and open decisions
- Code signing and notarisation identities; project licence (REL-03); dependency licence/advisory review (REL-03); aria2 not releasable (REL-05).
- `gh` not installed: CI conclusions via the public API only.

## Exact next task
1. Confirm CI #25 (`93faed3`) on all 4 runners: the admission tests on macOS/ubuntu-24.04, NB01–NB03 and NM01–NM04 (NM02's case-sensitive branch on Linux). Any failure is readable at `https://api.github.com/repos/DevSagar007/Downova/check-runs/<job id>/annotations`.
2. **B1.7: CORE-11 error catalogue:**
   - review every `ErrorKind` (including `DESTINATION_UNWRITABLE`) for user-facing text, `retryable` and `next_action`;
   - CLI messages; the English/Bangla catalogue the UI will use in B2.
3. Remaining B1 acceptance gaps: COR-08 `synchronous=FULL` benchmark; CORE-04 UI-kill and N-times repetition runs; then B2.
